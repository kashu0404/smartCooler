# SmartCooler Prototype

Welcome to SmartCooler, an innovative React-Native application designed to revolutionize the way we keep our beverages and snacks cool during outdoor adventures and picnics.

## Inspiration

With Summer being the season everyone looks forward to, picnics are at their peak. The need to constantly buy ice to protect your cold items from melting, it's essential to have a sustainable way to keep your food cool and save your pockets every time.

## What it does

SmartCooler is an innovative application designed to complement our cooler prototype. Our coolers utilize a unique mechanism powered by electricity and solar energy, ensuring your beverages and snacks stay refreshingly cool without the need for ice. Say goodbye to purchasing ice for picnics and dealing with the mess it creates. With SmartCooler, you invest in a long-term solution that guarantees a hassle-free outdoor experience, making picnics simple, clean, and eco-friendly.

## How SmartCooler Works

The SmartCooler uses a special liquid (refrigerant) that can change from liquid to gas and back again to keep drinks and snacks cool. It has solar panels to get energy from the sun, and its battery can also be plugged into a wall for power. It also consists of condenser and evaporator coils. The refrigerant enters the expansion device and as it passes through the evaporator coils, it absorbs heat from the cooler while a fan blows cold air over the drinks and snacks. Then the refrigerant goes through the compressor where its temperature is now raised. As it goes through the condensation coils, it releases heat to the atmosphere or through a heat sink designed to maximize heat dissipation, ensuring efficient cooling. This re-transforms the refrigerant to a liquid state. This process repeats and a temperature sensor keeps an eye on the temperature inside the cooler. If it starts to get too warm, it warns the compressor to pump more refrigerant and keeps nice and cool. This takes the hot air out as it absorbs This means you can have refreshingly cold drinks and snacks without the hassle of buying ice or dealing with the mess it creates, making picnics and outdoor gatherings simple, clean, and eco-friendly.
